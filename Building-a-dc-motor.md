# Building a dc motor


* __Step 1 – Build a commutator__
    * You have been supplied with a cork and adhesive copper tape.
    * Attach the tape so it can be used to form a commentator
    * You may need sell tape to increase the strength of the design

* __Step 2 – Add support shaft__
    * You have been supplied with two pins.
    * Press then into opposite sides of the cork to provide a main shaft for the armature
    * Be careful not to damage the commutator!

* __Step 3 – Wind the armature coil__
    * You have been supplied with about 10m of enamelled copper wire
    * Wind the wire around the cork.
    * Use sellotape to fix it down. Record how many turns you use. It should be at least 60 turns and preferably
more: Have used 60 turns

    * Make sure both ends of the wire will remain accessible.
    * Use sandpaper to remove the enamel at the ends: Used a soldering iron as well and checked it by spreading solder at the ends. If the enamel has gone then the solder spreads really well.
    * Solder the end of the coil wires onto the copper commutator sections
    * Measure the resistance of the coil: 2 Ohms

* __Improved Motor__
    * We used 2 windings 60 turns each
    * Made the commutator smoother the gaps in between smaller and added additional support so it stays in shape.

* __Improved Motor2__

    * We have designed the armature and the mounts in SolidWorks and made it so we can use 4 windings 100 turns each. We have used a screw for a shaft and the ball bearings from fidget spinners. Initially we used different ballbearings but we found that we did not pay attention to the abec number so the ballbearings that we used were to stiff.
    * For the commutator we have used foam pad on a nut and cut up a copper compression olive in 8 bits and stick it on the foam.

    * We made the mount of the magnets from wood.
    * For the encoder part I have made the disc out from cardboard and drilled a hole through the mount and placed the the led in the hole.

* __Motor characteristics__
    * Governing equations:
    * B (inside a solenoid) = µ0i(N/l)
    * Phi = BAcosø
    * T = phiIcZp/PI

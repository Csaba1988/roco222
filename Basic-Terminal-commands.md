## Basic Terminal commands
The following bullets are commands that can be entered into a terminal to achieve a certain result and an overview of what those results are.
+ "$ ls" will list the directory contents.
+ "$ cd /tmp" will move to a temporary directory (using the RAM) this will be deleted after this session, however using the RAM will mean it is a lot faster.
+ the command "cd" will change directory.
+ using the "$" sign will mean you dont have to type the entire route of the directory you are trying to reach when using the "cd" command. e.g. "cd $HOME" is the same as cd "/students/home".
+ "mkdir" will make a directory.
+ "echo "*thing*"" will write thing. " echo "Hello" > hello.md" will make a document and write "hello" in that document.

+ cp hello.md hello-again.md will create a "hello-again doc" and copy the contents of "hello" into "hello-again".
+ "mv hello-again.md hello-hello.md" will rename "hello-again" to "hello-hello".
+ "rm hello.md" will remove the doc "hello".
